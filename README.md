# FoodApp-SwiftUI
The Food sample app showcases how a food ordering experience can be built with localization and typography in mind. The app displays a curated menu of food and drinks, each available in multiple sizes, and guides users smoothly through the ordering process.

To deliver a polished, globally friendly UI, the app leverages several Foundation APIs:-
FormatStyle-based formatting ensures currency values, dates, times, and string collections are displayed correctly for each locale.
AttributedString with Markdown makes it easy to create rich, styled text that integrates seamlessly with SwiftUI views.
Localized attributed strings enable dynamic text construction at runtime, even when sentence structure and word order differ across languages.
Automatic grammar agreement adapts strings on the fly to respect grammatical gender and number, ensuring natural-sounding translations in supported languages.
Together, these tools highlight how SwiftUI and Swift can be used to build apps that are not only beautiful, but also linguistically accurate and globally scalable.
